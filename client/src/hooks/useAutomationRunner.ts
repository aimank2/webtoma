    // For now, assuming Home.tsx calls its `scheduleNotifications(INITIAL_AUTOMATION_NOTIFICATIONS)`
    // which in turn calls the `onScheduleInitialNotifications` passed to this hook.
    // To be very explicit as per user request:
    // onScheduleInitialNotifications should be called by Home.tsx, which then calls the function passed here.
    // If Home.tsx passes its own `scheduleNotifications` as `onScheduleInitialNotifications`, that's fine.
    // The key is that the initial sequence starts immediately.
    // Let's assume Home.tsx's `useAutomationRunner` call looks like:
    // useAutomationRunner({ onScheduleInitialNotifications: () => scheduleNotifications(INITIAL_AUTOMATION_NOTIFICATIONS), ... })
    // So, when runAutomation is called, Home.tsx has already (or will immediately) call its local scheduleNotifications.
    // To ensure it's the *very first* thing as per user request, Home.tsx should call its local `scheduleNotifications`
    // *before* calling `runAutomation(formDataInput)`.
    // The `onScheduleInitialNotifications` prop is more for the hook to trigger it if it were managing the constants.
    // Given Home.tsx now owns the constants, it's more direct for Home.tsx to initiate this.

    // However, to strictly follow the user's checklist for the hook:
    // If `FORM_FILLING_NOTIFICATIONS` were defined here or passed in:
    // onScheduleInitialNotifications(FORM_FILLING_NOTIFICATIONS_FROM_SOMEWHERE);
    // Since Home.tsx defines them, it's cleaner for Home.tsx to call its own `scheduleNotifications`
    // and pass that function as `onScheduleInitialNotifications`.
    // The current setup in the previous Home.tsx diff already does this effectively.
